# ThePageCommissionCalc

A simple comission calculator for contractors on thepage.co.uk

Allows you to work out the amount to charge for a given 'take-home', or the commission that will be owed charging a certain amount.

VAT can be toggled; if you charge VAT, then you can offset 20% of our comission, effectively lowering the commission by 20%.
